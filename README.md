Purpose: deal with the database, work with firebase_auth.

Task: Write an application similar to what was in the final one. There should be an authorization and registration page (use firebase_auth), recipe sheet, recipe details. The recipe can be saved to the database. Display saved recipes when there is no internet. (add animation when switching to screens, removing an item from the list, etc. will be ++ )

- the application will include two screens (item list and item details)
- you need to use bare queries to the database (for understanding) I suggest this plugin https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite
- the application has the ability to remove an item from the list and from the database
- it is possible to update the item data in the database (just change the name of the item (recipe))
